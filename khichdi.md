 - 2 cup sabat moong dal (whole moong lentils)

 - Spices: namak (salt), garam masala, jeera (cumin) – to your taste, haldi (turmeric) is optional

### Cooking

 - Place the sabat moong dal in a bowl and wash it thoroughly in cold water and place on the side. Do the same with the basmati rice.

 - Bring 2 cups of water to a boil over high heat and pour into the slow cooker and turn it on. Now pour in the sabat moong dal.

 - The khichdi will be ready in two or three hours. When it is ready, turn the slow cooker to warm and the khichdi will stay nicely warm and ready to eat throughout the day. There is no danger of the khichdi getting burnt or spilling over.
