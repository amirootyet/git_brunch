# Pad Thai

*Prep time: ~15 min*

*Cook time: 15 min*

### Ingredients

#### Pad Thai

 - 8 ounces brown rice pad thai noodles (I buy this brand – but you can also substitute brown rice fettuccini)
 - 1 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs, sliced into thin strips
 - Olive oil, for cooking
 - 1 red bell pepper, julienned into thin strips
 - 5–6 medium carrots, cut into matchsticks, or 1 1/2 cups shredded carrots
 - 1 medium shallot, minced
 - 3 teaspoons minced garlic
 - 2 eggs, beaten
 - 2 green onions, minced
 - 1/2 cup raw, unsalted peanuts, roughly chopped
 - 1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
 - 2 limes, cut into wedges

#### Sauce

 - 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce, or liquid aminos if gluten-free
 - 1 tablespoon real maple syrup
 - 2 tablespoons fish sauce
 - 2 tablespoon rice vinegar
 - 2 tablespoons natural peanut butter (smooth, not chunky)
 - 1 tablespoon chili paste
 - 1/2 teaspoon coriander
 - 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
 - 1/4 teaspoon pepper
 - Juice of 1 lime


### Cooking

 - Pre-chop all your veggies ahead of time (shallot, bell pepper, carrots, green onion, and cilantro), and pre-chop your chicken intro strips.
 - Bring a medium pot of water to a boil, and cook brown rice noodles to al dente according to package directions. Be careful not to overcook, as we want that perfectly finished noodle with a little bit of crunch left. The noodles will continue to cook a little longer in the sauce later.
 - While noodles are cooking, whisk together all sauce ingredients and set aside.
 - Once the noodles are cooked, immediately rinse under cold water so they don’t get sticky and hardened together. Drain, and add to a large mixing bowl. Toss with 1 teaspoon olive oil and set aside.
 - Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to a large nonstick skillet (I love using my cast iron for this), and heat over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add chicken strips and stir-fry until just cooked through. Then remove chicken and transfer to a plate.
 - Add another 1 tablespoon of olive oil to your skillet, and stir-fry your shallots and bell pepper for about 1 minute. Add carrots and minced garlic, and sauté another minute. Reduce heat to medium and pour beaten eggs over your veggies. Cook, stirring constantly, until eggs are scrambled.
 - Next, add your noodles and chicken to the pan, and pour the whisked sauce over top of everything. Toss until evenly combined, and cook 2-3 more minutes.
 - Garnish with chopped green onion, peanuts, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges, and drizzle fresh lime juice over top before enjoying.
