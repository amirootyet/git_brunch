# Instant Pot Shrimp Biryani

*Prep time: ~15 min*

*Cook time: 10 min*

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup basmati rice soaked in cold water for 15-30 minutes (I love this brand of basmati rice)
 - 2 tablespoons ghee or coconut oil
 - 1 tablespoon halved raw cashews
 - 1 tablespoon golden raisins
 - 2 red onions sliced

### Whole Spices

 - 4 cardamom pods
 - 3 whole cloves
 - 1- inch piece cinnamon
 - ½ teaspoon cumin seeds
 - 2 teaspoons minced garlic
 - 2 teaspoons ginger
 - 1 Serrano pepper or green chili minced, adjust to taste
 - 20 curry leaves
 - 1 to mato diced

### Ground Spices

 - 1 teaspoon garam masala
 - 1 teaspoon paprika
 - 1 teaspoon salt
 - ½ teaspoons black pepper adjust to taste
 - ½ teaspoon turmeric
 - 1 cup water
 - 1 pound frozen jumbo or extra jumbo raw shrimp

### Garnish

 - 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro garnish
 - 1 tablespoon chopped mint garnish

### Cooking

 - Soak the basmati rice in cold water for 15-30 minutes. Drain, rinse and set aside.
 - Press sauté, add the ghee or and once it melts, add the cashews and raisins. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, or until the cashews turn golden. Remove and set aside to be used later as garnish.
 - Next add the onions and whole spices. Stir fry for 10-12 minutes, or until the onions start to brown.
 - Add the garlic, ginger, Serrano pepper, curry leaves, stir, then add the tomato and ground spices. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes, or until the tomato begins to break down.
 - Add the rice and water, stir, then add the shrimp.
 - Secure the lid, close the pressure valve and cook for 6 minutes at high pressure.
 - Naturally release pressure for 10 minutes, then open the valve to release any remaining pressure.
 - Garnish with cilantro, mint and ghee-coated cashews.

### Notes

 - If you can't find curry leaves, you can leave them out. I like the flavor they add to the dish but the biryani will still be good without them.
 - Please use jumbo or extra jumbo shrimp as indicated. If you use smaller shrimp, they will most likely be overcooked.
