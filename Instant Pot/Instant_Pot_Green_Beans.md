# Instant Pot Green Beans

*Prep time: ~15 min*

*Cook time: 40 min*

### Ingredients

 - 1 tbsp Oil
 - ½ tsp Cumin seeds (Jeera)
 - 4 cloves Garlic chopped
 - 1 Green chili pepper chopped (optional)
 - 2 cup Green Beans chopped in ½ inch pieces
 - 1 Potato medium, cubed into small pieces
 - 3 tbsp Water

### Spices
 - 2 tsp Coriander powder (Dhaniya powder)
 - ¼ tsp Ground Turmeric (Haldi powder)
 - ¼ tsp Cayenne or Red Chili powder
 - 1 tsp Salt
 - 1 tsp Dry Mango powder (Amchur) (can be replaced with lemon juice)


### Cooking

  - Start the instant pot in sauté mode, heat it and then add oil. Heating the pot first helps later, so the veggies don't stick to the bottom. Then add cumin seeds, garlic and green chili.
 - When the cumin seeds start to splutter, add chopped green beans, potatoes and water. Add spices except dry mango powder and mix well. If anything is stuck to the bottom of the pot, scrape it off. 
 - Close the instant pot lid, and change setting to manual or pressure cook mode at high pressure for 2 minutes. When the instant pot beeps, release the pressure after 5 minutes of the beep. (Note: Quick release also works well for this recipe to retain the color of the green beans)
 - Mix in the dry mango powder. If there is any water, change the setting to sauté mode and get it to your desired consistency. Aloo Beans are ready to be served with roti or naan.
