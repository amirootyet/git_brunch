*Cook time: 28 min*

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup moong dal (or skinned split green gram)
 - 1 ½ cups water (same for IP)
 - 1 tablespoon oil (or ghee or butter)
 - 1 dried red chili (optional, broken)
  - ½ teaspoon cumin seeds ( jeera)
 - ¼ teaspoon mustard seeds (optional)
 - 1 pinch asafoetida (hing) (skip if you don't have)
 - 1 sprig curry leaves or bay leaf (optional)
 - 1 to 2 green chilies chopped (use as needed)
 - 1 teaspoon ginger garlic chopped or crushed (or ½ tsp ginger & ½ tsp garlic)
 - ¼ teaspoon turmeric
 - ¼ teaspoon red chilli powder (optional)
 - ¼ teaspoon garam masala (optional)

### Cooking

 -  Press the SAUTE button on your Instant pot.
  - Pour ghee or oil to the inner pot. Add cumin,mustard, dried red chilli and curry leaves or bay leaf.
 - When they splutter, add asafoetida (hing), onions and green chilies. Fry for about 2 mins until the onions turn transparent.
 - Then add in ginger, garlic, red chili powder, garam masala and turmeric. Give a quick stir.
 - Add in tomatoes, salt, rinsed dal and pour 1½ cups water.
  - Deglaze the inner pot by scrubbing with a spatula to release any bits of food stuck.
 - optional - Place a trivet and place your rice bowl.
 - Secure the IP with the lid. Position the steam release handle to sealing. Press PRESSURE COOK button and set the timer to 10 mins.
 - When the IP is done, press cancel and switch off. Wait for the pressure to release naturally for 10 mins.
 - Release the rest of the pressure manually. With the help of a spoon, gently move the steam release handle from sealing to venting. This releases the steam.
 - Sprinkle kasuri methi over the dal and mash it if you like it smooth. If the dal is too thick you can pour ¼ to ½ cup hot water and bring it to consistency. Taste it and add more salt if needed.
 - Garnish moong dal with coriander leaves and squeeze in lemon juice.
