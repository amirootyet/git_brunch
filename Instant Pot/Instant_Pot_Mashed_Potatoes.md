# Mashed Potatoes

*Prep time: ~10 min*

*Cook time: 25 min*

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup water
 - 3 to 3 1/2 pounds (4 large) russet potatoes, peeled and sliced 1-inch thick
 - 4 cloves garlic, peeled (optional)
 - 3/4 cup whole milk
 - 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
 - 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
 - 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
 - Chopped fresh chives or parsley, for garnish (optional)

### Cooking

 - Place a steamer basket in the bottom of your electric pressure cooker and add 1 cup of water. 
 - Add the sliced potatoes and peeled garlic cloves (if using) on top of the steamer basket.
 - Secure the lid on your pressure cooker and make sure the pressure release valve is set to its “sealing” position. Select the “Steam” or “Manual” setting and set the cooking time to 4 minutes at high pressure.
 - Quick release by moving the pressure release valve to its “venting” position.
 - Melt butter, warm cream: While the potatoes are cooking, melt the butter and warm the cream. You can heat them together in a pan on the stove or in the microwave.
 - Drain cooked potatoes, mash with butter, cream, milk: When the potatoes are done, drain the water and place the steaming hot potatoes into a large bowl. Pour the heated cream and melted butter over the potatoes. 
 - Mash the potatoes with a potato masher. Then use a strong wooden spoon (a metal spoon might bend) to beat further.
 - Add milk and beat until the mashed potatoes are smooth. Don't over-beat the potatoes or the mashed potatoes will end up gluey.
 - Add salt and pepper to taste.
