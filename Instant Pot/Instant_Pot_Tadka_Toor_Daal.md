### Ingredients for dal (lentils)

- 1 cup tuvar dal (arhar dal or split pigeon pea lentils) or 200 grams or ½ cup tuvar dal + ½ cup masoor dal (split pink lentils)
- 1 to 2 green chilies or serrano peppers – chopped or slit lengthwise
- 1 cup chopped onions or 1 medium sized onion
- 1 cup finely chopped tomatoes or 2 medium sized tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger or 1 inch ginger, peeled and finely chopped
- ½ teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric)
- ½ teaspoon Garam Masala Powder
- 1 pinch asafoetida (hing) – optional
- 3 1/2 cups water – for pressure cooking in instant pot
- 1 or 2 tablespoon low-fat cream – optional
- 2 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves (cilantro)
- 1 1/2 tsp salt (or as required)

 ### Ingredients for Tadka

 - 3 tablespoon oil or 3 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)
 - 1 teaspoon cumin seeds (+ 1 tsp mustard seeds)
 - 5 to 6 medium garlic cloves – finely chopped
 - 2 to 3 dry red chilies – broken and seeds removed
 - a generous pinch of asafoetida (hing) – optional
 - 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves) – optional
 - ½ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne pepper or paprika

### Cooking (lentils)

 -  Thoroughly rinse 1 cup toor dal (arhar dal, or split & husked pigeon pea lentils) in water. Add them to instant pot.
 - Add ½ of the chopped onions, 1 cup finely chopped tomatoes, 1 or 2 green chilies (1 teaspoon of chopped Anaheim pepper or Serrano pepper can be subbed for green chillies) and 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger + pinch of asafoetida.
 - Pour 3 cups of water into the pressure cooker.
 - Add ½ turmeric powder and 1 pinch of asafoetida (hing). If you do not have asafoetida, then skip it.
 - Mix well.
 - Pressure cook the lentils in instant pot for 10 minutes.
 - Naturally release pressure for 13 minutes.
- Mash the cooked lentils with a wired whisk or with a spoon and keep aside. If the consistency looks thick, then add about ½ – 1 cup water (depending on the thickness) to get a medium consistency. Simmer dal for 3 to 4 minutes.
 - Once the desired consistency is reached, add 1-2 tablespoons low-fat cream (optional), ½ teaspoon garam masala powder, 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and salt to taste. Switch off the the heat.
 - Mix well so that everything combines uniformly. Taste and adjust salt before adding tadka. 

### 

 - Heat 3 tablespoons oil or ghee (clarified butter) in a small pan over low-medium heat. First, add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds + 1 tsp mustard seeds + ½ of the chopped onion + 2 green chillies and crackle them. The cumin should get fried and not be raw, but be careful not burn them.
 - Now add 2 to 3 dry red chilies, a generous pinch of asafoetida, and 5-6 medium sized garlic cloves which have been finely chopped. Let the garlic brown lightly and the red chilies change color. Do not burn the garlic.
 - Lastly, add 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi (fenugreek seeds) and ½ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne pepper. Mix well and turn off the stove.
 - Pour entire tempering along with the oil or ghee into the dal.
 - You can either mix the dal with tempering, or serve the dal tadka with the tempering on top it. I personally like the aesthetic of having the tadka floating on top. Garnish with coriander leaves. Enjoy!
