# Stove Top Aloo Methi

*Prep time: ~15 min*

*Cook time: 15 min*

### Ingredients

 
 - 2 tablespoons oil use oil of choice, I used mustard oil
 - 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
 - 3-4 large garlic cloves sliced
 - 3-4 medium potatoes chopped, around 400 grams
 - 2 green chili chopped
 - 3 cups packed methi (fenugreek) leaves 75 grams, chopped, may double this quantity of methi for stronger methi flavor
 - 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
 - 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
 - 3/4 teaspoon kashmiri chili

### Cooking

 - Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan on medium heat. If using mustard oil, heat it well until its really hot and then lower the heat before adding the cumin seeds. 
 - Add cumin seeds, let them sizzle for few seconds and then add the garlic. Saute for few seconds until the garlic starts to change color.
 - Then add the chopped potato and green chili. Stir. You may also add chopped onion at this point.
 - Fry the potatoes in oil for 5 to 6 minutes until slightly golden brown. Toss them once or twice in between.
 - Add the chopped methi leaves, turmeric and salt and stir. 
 - Cook for 6 to 7 minutes (keep stirring in between) until the leaves are cooked, the moisture dries out and the potatoes are done. I have not added any water here but you may sprinkle some water and cover the pan with a lid to cook the potatoes faster.
 - Serve aloo methi with roti or any bread of choice.

### Notes

 - Cut small pieces of potatoes or they will not be cooked in time.
 - Double the quantity of methi leaves for stronger methi flavor.
