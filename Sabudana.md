# Sabudana

*Prep time: ~5 min*

*Cook time: 10 min*

### Ingredients

 
 - 1 cup sabudana 180 grams, sago/tapioca pearls
 - 1 cup water 8 oz
 - 1 tablespoon oil use oil of choice, I used avocado oil
 - 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
 - 1 medium potato 200 grams, diced small, around 1 cup diced potatoes
 - 2 tablespoons raw peanuts
 - 1-2 green chili chopped, adjust to taste
 - 6-7 curry leaves
 - 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
 - 1/2 teaspoon sugar optional
 - juice of 1/2 lemon
 - 1 tablespoon cilantro chopped

### Cooking

 - Rinse sabudana under water until water turns clear. This is important to get rid of all the starch.
 - Transfer the rinsed sabudana to a large bowl and add 1 cup water to it. No more.
 - In the morning the sabudana would have soaked up all the water. But you still drain it using a colander just to get rid of any excess water.
 - To check if sabudana is ready to cook, press a pearl between your thumb and index finger. It should smash easily. Set it aside.
 - Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for few seconds.
 - Then add the diced potatoes and cook for 3-4 minutes stirring often until potatoes are almost cooked. _It's important to dice the potatoes small here so that cook quickly_.
 - Add the raw crushed peanuts and for another 2-3 minutes. Peanuts will cook quickly.
 - Then add the green chili and curry leaves, and cook for 1 more minute.
 - Add the drained sabudana to the pan along with salt and sugar. Mix until well combined.
 - Cook for few minutes until most of the sabudana pearls become translucent, stirring once or twice. Do not cook it for a long time else it will become sticky. 
 - Remove pan from heat. Add lemon juice, sugar, and cilantro and toss to combine.
 - Serve sabudana khichdi hot with chilled yogurt.

### Notes

 - 1:1 ratio between sabudana and water overnight. More water will lead to sticky sabudana.
