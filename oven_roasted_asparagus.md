# Oven Roasted Asparagus

*Prep time: ~10 min*

*Cook time: ~17 min*

### Ingredients

 - Onion powder
 - Ginger powder
 - Asparagus
 - Salt
 - Pepper
 - Olive oil
 - Parmesan cheese

### Cooking

 - Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
 - Place the asparagus into a mixing bowl, and drizzle with the olive oil. Toss to coat the spears, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, garlic, salt, and pepper. Arrange the asparagus onto a baking sheet in a single layer. 
 - Bake in the preheated oven until just tender, 12 to 15 minutes depending on thickness. Sprinkle with lemon juice just before serving. 


### Notes

 - To remove woody ends, grab stalk of asparagus at either end and bend until it snaps. It will naturally snap where it starts to get tough.
