# Mediterranean White Bean Soup

### Ingredients

- 2 (15-ounce) cans white beans
- 1 medium yellow onion
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cups low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth
- 1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 Parmesan rind (optional)
- 5 ounces baby spinach (about 5 packed cups)
- Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving

### Cooking

  - Drain and rinse 2 cans white beans and set aside. 
  - Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion and mince 4 cloves garlic.
  - Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot until shimmering. 
  - Add the onion and sauté until softened and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. 
  - Add the garlic and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, if using, and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
  - Pour in 4 cups low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth, 1 can diced tomatoes and their juices, and the white beans. 
  - Add 2 fresh rosemary sprigs, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 1 Parmesan rind, if using, and stir to combine.
  - Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
  - Stir in 5 ounces baby spinach (about 5 packed cups), a few handfuls at a time, until just wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve garnished with grated Parmesan cheese.
