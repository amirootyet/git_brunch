*Prep time: ~10 min*

*Cook time: 20 min*

### Ingredients

 - 2 cups Thick poha
 - 1 potato cubed in medium size pieces
 - 1 big onion chopped finely
 - 1/2 cup peas
 - 1/2 tsp sugar (any kind) optional
 - 1 tsp salt or to taste
 - 1/2 lemon (juice extracted)
 - 1 tbsp peanuts

#### Tadka

 - R2 tsp coconut oil (or oil of choice)
 - 1 tsp mustard seeds
 - 2 to 3 green chillies (use as per spice levels)
 - 6 to 7 curry leaves
 - 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
 - 1/4 red chili powder

### Cooking

 - Take the poha in a colander and wash it in running water for a minute and not more than that. Drain and set it aside.
 - Switch on the saute mode in your IP and add the oil. When it becomes hot, add the ingredients given under "tadka"
 - When the mustard seeds splutter, add the onions and saute for a minute. (No need to brown the onions.)
 - Add the potatoes, peas, peanuts, 4 tbsp water, salt and switch off the saute mode immediately. The vegetables (onions, peas and potatoes should cover the bottom of the pan fully)
 - Close the lid and cook on manual high for 2 minutes and release pressure immediately.
 - On opening you will find a little bit of moisture in the mixture. If there is a lot of liquid, saute it for a couple of minutes until there is not much water. Then add the washed poha. Mix and close the lid again and let it rest for 10 minutes or more. (Do not switch on keep warm mode)
 - The poha will get cooked in the retained heat. After 10 minutes, open up and add some lemon juice and sugar. Adjust salt as need at this stage.
 - Garnish with coriander leaves and peanuts. Serve your instant pot poha recipe hot.
